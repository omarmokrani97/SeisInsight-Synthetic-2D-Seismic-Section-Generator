## Description

This software is designed to simulate synthetic seismic reflection and refraction phenomena based on user-provided seismic acquisition parameters and terrain model parameters.

#### Features

- Input Parameters: Allows users to input land seismic acquisition parameters (number of geophones, shot offset, geophone spacing) and terrain model parameters (thickness, velocity) for each layer.

- Output: Generates seismic section consists of numerous traces with location given along the x-axis and two-way traveltime. 
Also provides a table containing geophone positions, distances,and the time of arrival of direct waves, reflections, and first refractions.

- Visualization: Provides visualizations of synthetic seismic section based on user inputs.

- Flexibility: Allows users to adjust parameters and visualize the impact on synthetic seismic wave propagation.

## How To Use

#### Installation
This software is not yet ready for publication. There are some modifications that must be completed . STAY TUNED ! 

#### Usage : 

Input: Provide the required parameters through the user interface.
Visualization: View the generated graphs and tables.
Analysis: Analyze the results to understand the behavior of synthetic seismic waves in the specified terrain.

#### Exemple : 
Here's an example of how the software work:
#### Input parameters: 
Number of geophones: 24
Shot offset: 10 m
Geophone spacing: 10 m
#### Model 
Layer 1:
Thickness: 100 m
Velocity: 4000 m/s
Layer 2:
Thickness: 2000 m
Velocity: 6000 m/s
Layer 3:
Thickness: infinite 
Velocity: 8000 m/s

#### All data is calculated and collected in a table
