## Description

SeisInsight  is a software tool designed to generate synthetic 2D seismic sections based on user-defined acquisition geometry and subsurface layer properties. It is intended for educational purposes and conceptual demonstrations in the field of seismic exploration and geophysics. By providing a simplified representation of seismic data, SeisInsight  allows users to visualize and analyze theoretical scenarios without the complexities of real-world data.

#### Features

- Input Parameters: User-friendly interface for inputting land seismic acquisition parameters (number of geophones, shot offset, geophone spacing),Subsurface model parameters (thickness, velocity) for each layer and the types of seismic waves  to include in the simulation.

- Output: Generates seismic section consists of numerous traces with location given along the x-axis and two-way traveltime. 
Also provides a table containing geophone positions, distances,and the time of arrival of direct waves, reflections, and first refractions.

- Visualization: Provides visualizations of synthetic seismic section based on user inputs.

- Flexibility: Allows users to adjust parameters and visualize the impact on synthetic seismic wave propagation.

## How To Use

![Flow-chart](https://github.com/omarmokrani97/Synthetic-Seismic-Reflection-Modelling-Software/blob/main/Diagram%20chart.png?raw=true)

#### Installation
- Download: Obtain the software file from the repositories files [SeisInsight.exe].
- Run: Once downloaded, simply run the file to install the software on your system. 

#### Usage : 

##### 1. Define Acquisition Geometry
  - Input the number of geophones, geophone spacing, and shot offset.
  - These parameters define the setup of your seismic survey.
##### 2. Define Subsurface Layer Properties
  - Add Layer: Input the thickness and velocity of each layer to define the subsurface model.
  - Delete Layer: Remove any unnecessary layers from the model.
  - Reset Table: Clear all layer entries to start afresh.
##### 3. Choose Types of Seismic Waves
  - Select the types of seismic waves you want to include in your simulation (e.g., Direct Wave, Reflection Wave, Refraction Wave).
##### 4. Click "Calculate" Button
  - Once you have defined your acquisition geometry, subsurface layer properties, and selected the types of seismic waves, click the "Calculate" button to generate the synthetic seismic     section.
##### 5. View Results
  After calculation, you will be able to view the following:
  - Cross Section: A graphical representation of the subsurface layers.
  - Seismic Section: A 2D representation of the synthetic seismic data.
  - Data Table: A table containing calculated arrival times for each geophone and wave, with each wave type represented in a separate column.
